```

#### 2. Setup and Run the Service (Backend)

1. Navigate to the service repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd <service-repo-directory>
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the service:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
